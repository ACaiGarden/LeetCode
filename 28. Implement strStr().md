Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:
```
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```
Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

**My version:**
```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: 'str', needle: 'str') -> 'int':
        if needle == "":
            return  0
        for x in range(len(haystack)):
            if haystack[x:x+len(needle)] == needle:
                return x
        else:
            return -1

```

This problem should be solve in the more convenient way. But I have no idea about how to find the needle's position.

**My version NO.2 :**
```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: 'str', needle: 'str') -> 'int':
        if needle == "":
            return  0
        for x in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):
            if haystack[x:x+len(needle)] == needle:
                return x
        else:
            return -1

```

Nice!
