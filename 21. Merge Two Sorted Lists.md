Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:
```
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```

**My version:**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: 'ListNode', l2: 'ListNode') -> 'ListNode':
        head = ListNode(0)
        current_node = head

        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val <= l2.val:
                current_node.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
                current_node = current_node.next
            else:
                current_node.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
                current_node = current_node.next

        if l1:
            current_node.next = l1
        elif l2:
            current_node.next = l2
            
        return head.next

Emm..This problem is not difficult. Because its `l1` and `l2` is sequential. If not, it will be more difficult.
