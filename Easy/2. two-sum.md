Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
 ```
 
My rough version：
 ```python
 class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j:
                    return [i, j]
```

Then I see the smart programer use a special method to solve this problem:
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        lista = {}
        lista[target - nums[0]] = 0
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
                if(nums[i] in lista):
                    return [lista[nums[i]],i]
                else:
                    lista [target - nums[i]] = i
```
He use a `dict`  to solve it cleverly.

When it accept a new element from `nums` ,calculate the subtraction results between `target` and `nums[i]`.

Then store the result in `dict` ,the subtraction results as the `key` and the serial number `i` in `nums` as the `value`.

If the `num[i]` in `dict` ,return `i` and the `dict[nums[i]]`(the `value` which the `key`=`i`) as `[lista[nums[i]], i]`.

-------------

dict's form:
```
dict = {target - nums[i] : i}
```
dict's key is the number what `nums[i]` needs to add together.

dict's valuse is its serial number `i`.

When the **new**`nums[i]` come and be found in the dict(`key`)，we can get the serial number of the previous number from the dict.
