The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```
```
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
```
Given an integer n where` 1 ≤ n ≤ 30`, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

Example 1:
```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

**My version :**
```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: 'int') -> 'str':
        num = '1'
        for x in range(n - 1):
            num = self.count(num)
        return num

    def count(self, str1):
        count = 1
        return_list = []
        for x in range(len(str1)):
            try:
                if str1[x] == str1[x + 1]:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    return_list.append(str(count))
                    return_list.append(str1[x])
                    count = 1
            except:
                return_list.append(str(count))
                return_list.append(str1[x])
        return ''.join(return_list)

I took a lot of effort to understand the question meaning. And it is the final easy problem in the first page. Then I am going to resolve the medium problem.
