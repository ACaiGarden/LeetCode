You are given two *non-empty* linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. 
Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:
```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

My version:
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        """
        :type l1: ListNode
        :type l2: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        head = ListNode(0)
        self.current_node = head
        self.carry = 0

        while l1 and l2:

            value = (l1.val + l2.val + self.carry) % 10
            self.carry = (l1.val + l2.val + self.carry) // 10
            self.current_node.next = ListNode(value)
            self.current_node = self.current_node.next
            l1 = l1.next
            l2 = l2.next


        if l1:
            self.one_count(l1)
        elif l2:
            self.one_count(l2)

        if self.carry != 0:
            self.current_node.next = ListNode(1)


        return head.next

    def one_count(self, l):
        while l:
            value = (l.val + self.carry) % 10
            self.carry = (l.val + self.carry) // 10

            self.current_node.next = ListNode(value)
            self.current_node = self.current_node.next

            l = l.next

This challenage troubled me for serrval days.I can't imagine how to deal with the data structure.Such as how to construct the return list,how to deal with the carry and what should I do when the two lists have different length.

So happly that I solve my first medium problem.
