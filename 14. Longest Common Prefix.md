Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:
```
Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```
Note:

All given inputs are in lowercase letters `a-z`.

*My version:*
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: 'List[str]') -> 'str':
        if strs == []:
            return ''
        
        common_prefix = ''

        for x in range(len(strs[0])):
            for word in strs:
                try:
                    if word[x] != strs[0][x]:
                        return common_prefix
                except:
                    break
            else:
                common_prefix += strs[0][x]

        return common_prefix

#Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 99.06% of Python3 online submissions for Longest Common Prefix.
#Memory Usage: 6.6 MB, less than 37.10% of Python3 online submissions for Longest Common Prefix.
```

The main problem is that how to use `for` suitably.
